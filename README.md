 👋 Hi, I’m @canke326.  I have been a software developer on IBM mainframe OS/390 which eventually became the more 
 marketing-friendly IBM Mainframe System z/OS.  After starting my career with Platinum Technology, which was bought and 
 merged into Computer Associates (aka CA Inc.) - I worked on a software product called SQL-Ease for DB2 database tools, 
 and ultimately another product called Plan Analyzer (PPA) for DB2 database tools.  These products were written in a 
 language (?) known as HLASM, or high-level assembler.  These products were part of the DB2 SQL performance analysis 
 suite of database tools used by customers to enable them to more easily manage their DB2 database on z/OS.
